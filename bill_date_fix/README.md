**#Invoice Date Validation Fix**  

## 📌 Overview  
This module is designed to enhance the validation of invoice dates in Odoomates **Accounting module V17**. The primary goal is to prevent users from setting an invoice date that conflicts with the system’s accounting rules, ensuring compliance with financial policies.  

---

## 🛠️ Issue  
In the standard **Accounting module**, users could manually set an invoice date that precedes a system-defined restriction (e.g., a lock date). This could lead to errors during invoice posting, causing unexpected validation failures.  

### 🔴 Symptoms  
- Attempting to post an invoice resulted in an error.  
- The invoice date conflicted with accounting restrictions.  
- Manual adjustments were needed to fix the issue.  

---

## ✅ Solution  
This module introduces a mechanism to automatically adjust the invoice date if it violates accounting constraints.  

### 🔹 Fix Implementation  
1. **Automated Date Adjustment**  
   - When an invoice is created, the system validates the date.  
   - If the date is invalid, it is automatically adjusted to comply with accounting rules.  

2. **View Modification**  
   - The invoice form now reflects the corrected date, preventing user errors.  

3. **Error Handling & Debugging**  
   - A validation layer ensures that incorrect dates are handled gracefully.  
   - Logs provide detailed error messages for easy troubleshooting.
