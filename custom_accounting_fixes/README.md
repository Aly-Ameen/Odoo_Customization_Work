**🔹 Dynamic Payment Terms Handling in Odoo**


_**📌 Problem Statement_**
Odoomates accointing module default payment handling did not dynamically adapt to newly created payment terms. The system correctly processed predefined terms (e.g., 30%-70%) but failed when new payment structures (e.g., 4 or 5 installments) were introduced. This caused:

1-Incorrect installment tracking after the first payment.
2-Overpayment or miscalculated balances.
3-Payment flag issues (e.g., missing "Partial" or "Paid" statuses).


**_✅ Solution Implemented**_
We developed a fully dynamic payment logic that:
✔ Supports any number of payment installments (percentage-based or fixed-amount).
✔ Correctly applies payments across multiple terms instead of assuming a fixed number.
✔ Tracks each installment properly to prevent incorrect payment applications.
✔ Ensures no overpayment occurs beyond the invoice total.
✔ Maintains proper invoice statuses ("Partial", "Paid") based on actual payments.


**_🚀 How It Works**_
The logic dynamically:
1️⃣ Retrieves the invoice & checks for payment terms.
2️⃣ Fetches & sorts the payment term installments based on due dates.
3️⃣ Tracks total paid amounts and remaining balance.
4️⃣ Dynamically allocates payments to the correct installment.
5️⃣ Ensures the next suggested payment aligns with the defined terms.
